    "## The goal of this project is the investigate \"How event driven is Wikipedia?\"\n",
    "- To reach a conclusion I can look for points of anomalies in the time series plot and look for a justification from another event dataframe (main events, birthdays , celebrations , deaths , release dates ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem for this project is that in order to answer this question we need to evaluate wikipedia as a whole website not just select some articles\n",
    "- Solution:  An idea could be to generate 10000 of  datatframes (people , events , science , art , dates ...) and then evaluate the time series dataframes.\n",
    "- We can also have a language feature (fr, en , de ...) and then evaluate the user behaviour when it comes to language.\n",

    "- Specifically we want to select classes  in each of the defined cathegories: disasters, culture.\n",
    "    - disasters will contain 3 classes: air accidents, Train collisions, helicopters\n",
    "        - air accidents will contain the names of the air accidents that occured from 2015 to this day\n",
    "    - culture will contain 3 classes: films, actors, charactors\n",
    "        - each class will contain apropriate events that occured from 2015 to this day\n",
    "        \n",

    "- This page documents the Pageview API (v1), you can get pageview trends on specific articles or projects; filter by agent type or access method, and choose different time ranges and granularities; you can also get the most viewed articles of a certain project and timespan, and even check out the countries that visit a project the most. \n",
